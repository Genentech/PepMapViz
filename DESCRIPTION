Description: A versatile R visualization package that empowers 
    researchers with comprehensive visualization tools for seamlessly mapping peptides 
    to protein sequences, identifying distinct domains and regions of interest, 
    accentuating mutations, and highlighting post-translational modifications, 
    all while enabling comparisons across diverse experimental conditions. 
    Potential applications of PepMapViz include the visualization of cross-software 
    mass spectrometry results at the peptide level for specific protein and domain 
    details in a linearized format and post-translational modification coverage 
    across different experimental conditions; unraveling insights into disease 
    mechanisms. It also enables visualization of MHC-presented peptide clusters in 
    different antibody regions predicting immunogenicity in antibody drug development.
